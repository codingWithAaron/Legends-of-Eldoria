# Legends of Eldoria: A Hero's Journey

Legends of Eldoria: A Hero's Journey is a text based adventure game which has the player choose between two options along their journey. The decisions that the player makes will alter the course of their adventure! 

It is set in the fantastic realm of Eldoria! It has knights, dragons, magic, and much more! 

The story was created with the help of AI (ChatGPT).

# Inspiration

The inspiration for this game came from my love of video games and the creative story telling and adventures of Dungeons and Dragons. As I am building this, I imagine the graphics are like the game Octopath Traveler, which are described as "HD-2D". According to online, it is described by the developers as "combining retro Super NES-style character sprites and textures with polygonal environments and high-definition effects."

While there are no graphics or visuals yet, my goal is to continue to work on this project and incorporate those aspects to the game. As of right now, it is Theater of the Mind!

# Tools and Skills

React, JavaScript, Boostrap, and CSS were used to create this game. The app takes advantage of Routes and Links to have the screen change and update as you move through the game to display the next set of content.
