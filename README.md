# Inspiration

The inspiration for this game came from my love of video games and the creative story telling and adventures of Dungeons and Dragons. As I am building this, I imagine the graphics are like the game Octopath Traveler, which are described as "HD-2D". According to online, it is described by the developers as "combining retro Super NES-style character sprites and textures with polygonal environments and high-definition effects."
